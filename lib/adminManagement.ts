ðŸ”§ Admin Setup Instructions:

1. First, create an account using the signup page (/signup)
2. After creating an account, note your user ID (UID) from the browser console or Firebase Auth
3. Use one of these methods to set yourself as admin:

   Method 1 - Browser Console:
   AdminManagement.setAdminByUserId("your-user-id-here")

   Method 2 - Firebase Console:
   - Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database
   - Find your user document in the "users" collection
   - Edit the document and add/change the "role" field to "admin"

4. Refresh the page - you should now have admin access!

Note: Make sure you're signed in and your user document exists in Firestore.
